        <h1>Jon Bellion - All Time Low</h1>
        <div class="song_text">
            I was the knight in shining armor in your movie
            Would put your lips on mine and love the aftertaste
            Now I'm a ghost, I call your name, you look right through me
            You're the reason I'm alone and masturbate

            I, yeah, I've been trying to fix my pride
            But that shit's broken, that shit's broken
            Lie (lie, lie), lie, l-lie, I try to hide
            But now you know it

            That I'm at an all time
            Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
            Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low (x4)
            
            I was the prototype like 3 stacks on that CD
            An example of the perfect candidate
            Now all your girlfriends say that you don't want to see me
            You're the reason that I just can't concentrate

            I, yeah, I've been trying to fix my pride
            But that shit's broken, that shit's broken
            Lie (lie, lie), lie, l-lie, I try to hide
            But now you know it

            That I'm at an all time
            Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
            Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low (x4)

            I, yeah, I've been trying to fix my pride
            But that shit's broken, that shit's broken
            Lie (lie, lie), lie, l-lie, I try to hide
            But now you know it

            That I'm at an all time
            Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
            Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low (x4)
